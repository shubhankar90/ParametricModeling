# Parametric-Modelling
User defined parametric model fitting to data.

The aim of this project is to enclose scipy least_squares function in a sklearn type interface for easier usage.

The class is useable as given in the Parametric Modelling jupyter notebook with only the basic functionality of sklearn.

Currently a work in progress.
